<body><h1> Problem Creation Tools for edX Authors</h1><p>A number of scripts are available to assist edX authors in creation
of problems.  These include:</p><pre>
  latex2edx -- a set of scripts for converting latex-format problem sets into edX format
  word2edx -- a set of scripts for importing microsoft Word format problem sets into edX format


</pre><p>
These tools are rather rudimentary at this point in time, but they
have already been tested on files from at least one course.  None of
these tools automates the process of generating good assessment
problems, ie with proper problem checking code, and well framed questions.
